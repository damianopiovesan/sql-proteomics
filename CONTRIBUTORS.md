Materials have been developed and adapted by many contributors and were originally adapted from Software Carpentry materials.

The first workshop was run at NESCent on May 8-9, 2014 with the development and
instruction of lessons by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal and Ethan White and contributions from Deb Paul and Mike Smorul.

The HGNC gene symbol mapping has been retrieved by querying the EnsMart portal (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview). 

	Database: Ensembl Genes 79
	Dataset: Homo sapiens genes (GRCh38.p2)
	Attributes:

		EXTERNAL: HGNC symbol


## Lessons


### SQL

Original materials adapted from Software Carpentry SQL lessons for ecologists by
Ethan White, which were adapted from Greg Wilson's original SQL lessons.
The sql preoteomics lesson has been adapted by Damiano Piovesan at the Data Carpentry Hackathon
in Espoo, Finland on the 16-17 March 2015.
